SCENE OVERVIEW:

My Scene is a Sci-fi third-person shooter for the main goal of showcasing my use and 
knowledge of Shaderlab and Shaders, Lighting and LUTs. 

to play the game:
open the "MainGame" scene and hit play

Win: 
Obliterate 30 Aliens

Lose:
You are touched by an enemy

-----------------------------

WHAT I CHANGED

lots of the class slide specifically hologram were done in URP. I have been striving to learn
Shaderlab and used unique solutions in shader lab avoiding copying code from class to succeed.
using tutorials and educational documentation (unity doc). I also spoke with peers and cohorts
to weed out problems and work towards a final product that provides me more insight. looking at my
code should hopefully show that my solutions are different (maybe inefficient or subpar) but unique

WHY I CHOSE MY SHADERS

as stated in my video I've been aiming for a Sci-fi look so rim lighted, brightly coloured visors
along with hologram effects fit the scene I'm aiming for as I think glowing visors and holograms
fit a sci-fi theme.

the lighting effects were a progressive increase in fidelity and only felt like a natural progress
as well as the specular and Blinn-Phong have a glossy future look if utilized correctly.

the two non-custom LUTS were made with the idea of display LUTS. the custom shader was made on 
personal preference to emphasize my person opinions on how I feel about the theming of my project.
My project feels retro Sci-fi and the over saturated retro colouration really makes that theming pop.
